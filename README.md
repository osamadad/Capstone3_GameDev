# dev nest

This system is a collaboration platform designed to connect game developers, studios, and investors. Users can create profiles, showcase their skills, join studios, and apply for project roles that match their expertise. Studios can create projects, define positions, recruit talent, and manage their teams. Investors can explore projects, submit investment requests, and fund the ones they believe in. Through structured workflows—such as project applications, studio invitations, and investment approvals—the platform provides a complete ecosystem that supports the creation, management, and growth of game development teams and their projects.
